# Installation Instructions

### Clone Repo via SSH or HTML
    git clone git@github.com:dgutman/nci-dsa-deid.git
or
    git clone https://github.com/dgutman/nci-dsa-deid.git

### Other requirements
Docker must be installed, including the docker compose plugin.  This varies depending on the platform.  
The user who will start/stop the DSA container(s) also needs to be able to start the docker containers themselves.  This can usually be done by adding them to the 
the docker user group.
    
### You can either build the docker containers locally or pull from upstream
