## Whole-Slide Image DeIdentifier for NCI


This tool is based on core Digital Slide Archive (DSA) components and provides a workflow for the deidentification of digital pathology slide image files from Leica Aperio, Hamamatsu, and Philips scanners. This deidentification is critical, so that digital slide files may be shared for research. The WSI DeID Tool enables users to view all the associated metadata in the WSI, use automated business rules to redact or replace specific whole slide image (WSI) metadata fields, review the changes as part of deidentification quality control verification, and export the deidentified WSI files in the original vendor format.
